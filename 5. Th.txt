// Story Text

#StoryText00100,At the end of our usual deal, Amelia made me a strange offer.
#StoryText00150,The broker suggested we work together.
#StoryText00200,If I worked with Amelia, the top slaver in the country... it was an risky opportunity to make a lot of money.
#StoryText00300,I accepted her offer immediatly.
#StoryText00350,Because I want to make slaves become pregnant over and over again...

#StoryText00400,Well... I have to go through some tests before I leave the job to you.
#StoryText00500,Let's see if you can make a profit for our organization.
#StoryText00600,I'll leave this territory to you for the time being.
#StoryText00700,After <color=#FFFF00>'50 days'</color>, if you are proffitable, you can keep it.
#StoryText00750,Don't worry. I'll help you at first.
#StoryText00760,Let's start by breeding and selling monsters first.

#StoryText00800,Build a cage for monsters and slaves.
#StoryText00900,Build a Slave Cage.
#StoryText01000,Build a Monster Cage.

#StoryText01100,Well, I'll gift you some slaves and monsters.
#StoryText01200,Try not to kill them off.
#StoryText01300,Slaves and monsters have different looks and races.
#StoryText01400,Also, each race has different Traits. Try to breed the best slaves possible. 
#StoryText01500,<color=#FFFF00>'Human'</color> girls have few magic properties, but they make good brothel whores.<BR>Specialized traits: <color=#63E057>Conception rate +5%</color>, <color=#63E057>Growth time -5</color>, <color=#E07369>Max Health -15</color>, <color=#E07369>Pregnancy possibility -3</color>
#StoryText01600,<color=#FFFF00>'Goblin'</color> is a basic race, but it has a short mating time.<BR>Specialized traits: <color=#63E057>Growth time -5</color>, <color=#E07369>Conception rate -5%</color>

#StoryText02550,Now let me tell you how to <color=#FFFF00>'breed'</color>.
#StoryText02600,Build a breeding room.
#StoryText02700,Move the monster to the breeding room.
#StoryText02800,Move the slave to the breeding room.
#StoryText02900,Well, there he goes. He should take it from here. Once she gets pregnant, make full use of the offspring.

#StoryText03000,Now let's talk about <color=#FFFF00>'selling'</color> and <color=#FFFF00>'buying'</color>.
#StoryText03100,If you want to <color=#FFFF00>'sell'</color> slaves or monsters, bring them to the carriage.

#StoryText03200,You want to buy a new product?
#StoryText03300,One moment...
#StoryText03400,I work every day during the <color=#FFFF00>'day'</color> hours as a legitimate <color=#FFFF00>'slave'</color> trader.
#StoryText03500,If you want to purchase <color=#FFFF00>'Monsters'</color>, wait until <color=#FFFF00>'Night'</color>.
#StoryText03600,Because trading monsters is frowned upon.
#StoryText03700,If you want to buy a monster or a slave, just <color=#FFFF00>'drag & drop'</color> the product and drop it in the right place.
#StoryText03800,You can quickly sell and purchase products using the <color=#FFFF00>'quick menu'</color>.

#StoryText25200,From now on, I will make sure to receive <color=#FFFF00>'reimbursement'</color> once every <color=#FFFF00>'5 days'</color>.
#StoryText25300,Rather than money... <color=#FFFF00>'Monsters'</color> would be better.
#StoryText25400,I'll let you give monsters instead of other services.
#StoryText25500,Amilia receives a <color=#FFFF00>'monster reward once every 5 days'</color>.

#StoryText05350,Oh, and lastly, don't mind the basement, as it was built by the previous owner and doesn't mean much. (~Please wait for the DLC~). 
#StoryText05400,Then do your best, co-worker â™¥

#StoryText06500,The slaves can <color=#FFFF00>'infect monsters'</color> and <color=#FF0000>'eventually die'</color>.

#StoryText04500,Looks like the slave is <color=#FFFF00>'pregnant'</color>. Wonderfull. Slaves love being impregnated against thier will, you know.
#StoryText04600,Build a DeliveryRoom to give <color=#FFFF00>'birth'</color> to new girls and monsters.
#StoryText04700,Please raise this baby well, because it has value only when he is an adult.
#StoryText04800,Build a deliveryroom.
#StoryText04900,Move the slave to the deliveryroom and give birth.

#StoryText06700,The slave gave birth to a baby.
#StoryText06710,Please move the spawn to the cage.
#StoryText06800,You can <color=#FFFF00>'pump breast milk'</color> from  slaves who have gotten pregnant and given birth.
#StoryText06900,Let's see how to pump breast milk.
#StoryText07000,Build a milking room.
#StoryText07100,Move the slave to the milking room.
#StoryText07200,Breast milk is produced after a slave gives birth. Thier milk will slowly increase from henceforth. Bigger tits make more milk.
#StoryText07300,Click on the milk tank to collect a milk bottle.
#StoryText09500,Click on the milk tank behind the milking room get the item.
#StoryText09600,The milk tank stores a large amount of milk, so click on the milk tank to get milk as needed. Be sure to make lots of girls pregnant and pump lots of milk~ 

#StoryText09700,Slaves have <color=#FFFF00>'health'</color> states, which <color=#FFFF00>'decrease when breeding with monsters'</color> and <color=#FF0000>'die when they reach 0'</color>.
#StoryText09800,Better to <color=#FFFF00>'restore health'</color> by letting the slaves rest in the <color=#FFFF00>'cage'</color> before they become useless.

#StoryText25800,I received the delivery.
#StoryText25900,Well done. In return, I'll reward you.
#StoryText26000,Select the <color=#FFFF00>'slave product to be on special'</color>.

#StoryText26300,Here's the next goal.
#StoryText26400,See you in five days.

#StoryText27300,Thanks to your hard work, a <color=#FFFF00>'Pixie'</color> was created.
#StoryText27400,You can take care of the slaves more comfortably through the use of Pixies~
#StoryText27500,If you <color=#FFFF00>'dismantle more than a certain number of creatures, a Pixie is created'</color>. You can <color=#FFFF00>'take care of slaves automatically via Pixies'</color>.
#StoryText27600,Pixies fly freely around the field and perform the following functions.
#StoryText27900,When a slave's health falls below a certain level, it is moved to a nearby slave cage to restore health and return to its original position.
#StoryText28000,When a slave becomes pregnant, it is moved to a nearby delivery room to give birth and return to its original position.
#StoryText28050,Move babies in the delivery room to an empty cage.
#StoryText28100,When the slave's milk is full, it is moved to a nearby milking room and returned to the original position after milking.
#StoryText28200,One pixy can only handle one task at a time, and as slaves and monsters increase, more pixies may be needed.

#StoryText29100,Oh, did you get something interesting?
#StoryText29200,You can use it <color=#FFFF00>'to create monster or slave with random status'</color>
#StoryText29250,Appearance and traits are random. Instead, I'll make it better than the existing products.
#StoryText29300,If you put your DNA here, I'll make it whatever you want, whether it's a slave or a monster~
#StoryText29400,You can get <color=#FFFF00>'special DNA items'</color> by <color=#FFFF00>'dismantling'</color> them. If you take it to Niel, you can create slaves or monsters with random traits.
#StoryText29500,There are <color=#FFFF00>'monsters that can only be obtained through DNA'</color>, so please take advantage of them.

#StoryText29600,Darling~, what you ordered is complete~
#StoryText29700,Here you go~

#StoryText29800,Oh, long time no see?
#StoryText29900,You can make anything with this~
#StoryText30000,Even if they were <color=#FFFF00>'extinct in ancient times'</color>~
#StoryText30100,If you use <color=#FFFF00>'origin DNA'</color>, you can create amy slaves or monsters, and you can also create <color=#FFFF00>'large monsters that were extinct in ancient times'</color>.
#StoryText30200,<color=#FFFF00>'Large monsters'</color>  <color=#FFFF00>'Require a dedicated cage and dedicated breeding room'</color> and <color=#FFFF00>'Breeding'</color> for <color=#FFFF00>'It takes a lot of work, such as 'need a special slave with Multiple Pregnancy of three'</color>. That's why the <color=#FFFF00>'value is high'</color>.

#StoryText30400,This is a elf slave sold to our company.
#StoryText30600,This is a furry slave sold to our company.
#StoryText30700,This is a small furry slave sold to our company.
#StoryText30800,This is a dragonian slave sold to our company.
#StoryText30900,I hope you enjoy breeding her.

#StoryText31000,A new product has been added.
#StoryText31100,It was difficult to secure a source.
#StoryText31200,<color=#FFFF00>'Elves'</color> are a magical minority and have excellent physical strength and do not get along with dwarves. They value virginity and consider it shameful to lose it.<BR>Specialized traits: <color=#63E057>Maintenance Cost -5</color>, <color=#63E057>Max health +15</color>, <color=#E07369>Conception rate -5%</color>, <color=#E07369>Growth time +5</color>, <color=#E07369>Multiple pregnancy -1</color>
#StoryText31300,It was pretty hard to find where they were hiding because they dig so deeply underground.
#StoryText31400,<color=#FFFF00>'Dwarves'</color> are a minority tribe with excellent physical abilities and recover quickly. They don't get along very well with the elves. They think it's a virtue to be prolific.<BR>Specialized traits: <color=#63E057>Conception rate +5%</color>, <color=#63E057>Max birth count +3</color>, <color=#63E057>Multiple pregnancy +1</color>, <color=#E07369>Growth time +5</color>, <color=#E07369>Maintenance Cost +5</color>
#StoryText31500,It was pretty hard to catch them running around in the woods.
#StoryText31600,<color=#FFFF00>'Furries'</color> are a multi-ethnic race. They are physically weak and optimized to spread their genes.<BR>Specialized traits: <color=#63E057>Conception rate +10%(Common)</color>, <color=#63E057>Multiple pregnancy +1(Neko)</color>, <color=#63E057>Growth time -10(Inu)</color>, <color=#E07369>Max health -30(Common)</color>, <color=#E07369>Growth time +10(Neko)</color>, <color=#E07369>Maintenance Cost +10(Inu)</color>
#StoryText31700,It was quite difficult to catch these hiding in the woods.
#StoryText31800,<color=#FFFF00>'Small furries'</color> are a multi-ethnic race. They are physically weak and optimized to spread their genes.<BR>Specialized traits: <color=#63E057>Conception rate +10%(Common)</color>, <color=#63E057>Max birth count +6(Usago)</color>, <color=#63E057>Maintenance Cost -10(Hitsuji)</color>, <color=#E07369>Max health -30(Common)</color>, <color=#E07369>Growth time +10(Hitsuji)</color>, <color=#E07369>Maintenance Cost +10(Usago)</color>
#StoryText31900,These were really hard to catch. 
#StoryText32000,<color=#FFFF00>'Dragonian'</color> is a Strong race and gives priority to positive traits.<BR>Specialized traits: <color=#63E057>Conception rate +10%</color>, <color=#63E057>Growth time -10</color>, <color=#63E057>Max health +30</color>, <color=#63E057>Max birth count +6</color>, <color=#E07369>Maintenance Cost +10</color>, <color=#E07369>Multiple pregnancy -1</color>
#StoryText32100,It's hard to catch monsters this big.
#StoryText32200,<color=#FFFF00>'Orcs'</color> are slow to breed and their young grow faster.<BR>Specialized traits: <color=#63E057>Conception rate +5%</color>, <color=#E07369>Breeding time +5</color>
#StoryText32300,They are rough, so please be careful while handling them.
#StoryText32400,<color=#FFFF00>'Werewolf's'</color> mating rate is very fast and their children grow very fast.<BR>Specialized traits: <color=#63E057>Breeding time -5</color>, <color=#E07369>Slave's health consumption during breeding +0.05</color>

#StoryText09900,The slave has <color=#FF0000>â€™diedâ€™</color>.
#StoryText10000,The slave <color=#FFFF00>'dies and the room decays over time'</color>.
#StoryText10100,Then other slaves and monsters in the room may get <color=#FF0000>'venereal disease'</color>.
#StoryText10200,Let's build a morgue and burry the slave.
#StoryText10300,Build a morgue.
#StoryText10400,Move the slave to the morgue. 
#StoryText10500,When a room is contaminated, click the clean room icon to clean the room.
#StoryText10600,If there is no space in the morgue, you can <color=#FFFF00>'burial the body through Amilia'</color>.<BR>However, in this case, <color=#FFFF00>'additional cost'</color> is incurred.

#StoryText32500,Depravity of slave has risen a little, right?
#StoryText32600,The higher the depravity, the more obedient you will fulfill your duty.
#StoryText32700,You may sell depraved slaves to get a higher price.
#StoryText32800,Good luck with that.
#StoryText32900,Slaves have the status of depravity.
#StoryText33000,<color=#FFFF00>'Depravity'</color> can be raised through <color=#FFFF00>'Sex, Childbirth, and Milking'</color>. The higher the depravity, the <color=#FFFF00>'Slave Price'</color> and <color=#FFFF00>'The price increases when services are provided at the brothel'</color>, and the <color=#FFFF00>'Trait are upgraded'</color>.
#StoryText33100,Also, the higher the depravity, the less likely the slave will escape from the brothel. 

#StoryText33200,Slaves have various stats.
#StoryText33300,Monsters have various stats.
#StoryText33400,They have race trait that are fixed for each race.
#StoryText33500,Their general trait is the trait that grows their stats. They can be handed over through mating and can also hand over traits that are not related to them.
#StoryText33600,If you use this well, you can breed strong offspring.

#StoryText07400,The baby girl has grown up.
#StoryText07500,She can now get pregnant and give birth. However, let's grow again.
#StoryText07600,Breastfeeding will help the girl grow up.
#StoryText07700,The baby is now a loli body shape. If you drink more breast milk, she will grow into an adult body shape.
#StoryText07750,Drag and drop breast milk to her.
#StoryText07800,<color=#FFFF00>'Loli girls'</color> have the <color=#FFFF00>'same womb as adults and can be pregnant and give birth'</color>, but <color=#FF0000>'recovery of health is slow'</color>.

#StoryText33700,<color=#FFFF00>'Breast milk'</color> has many uses, it can help your <color=#FFFF00>'child grow or develop new traits'</color>.
#StoryText33800,Let's try the breast milk obtained this time.
#StoryText33900,Feeding slaves with breast milk has a chance to reveal new traits or evolve existing traits.

#StoryText34000,Breastfeed one of your slaves.
#StoryText34100,The traits of slaves have been upgraded, in this way you can correct the traits of slaves.
#StoryText34200,Well, go ahead and breed a race of super-slaves already.

#StoryText34300,You're doing well, so time to give you more responsibility. Our biggest monster yet.
#StoryText34400,It is a <color=#FFFF00>'restored DNA of an ancient monster that was extinct'</color>.
#StoryText34500,First, leave this <color=#FFFF00>'goblin'</color> to <color=#C27AEB>'Flora'</color> to <color=#FFFF00>'dismantle it'</color>.
#StoryText34600,Did you get the <color=#FFFF00>'DNA'</color>?
#StoryText34700,If you give the <color=#FFFF00>'DNA'</color> to <color=#4DF4E4>'Noel'</color>, you can <color=#FFFF00>'remake the extinct monster'</color>.
#StoryText34800,<color=#FFFF00>'origin DNA'</color> is <color=#FFFF00>'an item that comes out with a certain probability'</color> when dismantling a monster or slave.
#StoryText34900,You can use this to craft <color=#FFFF00>'all monsters and slaves as well as monsters that were destroyed in ancient times'</color>.

#StoryText35000,Have you acquired a large monster?
#StoryText35100,Large monsters require <color=#FFFF00>'dedicated cages'</color> and <color=#FFFF00>'dedicated breeding rooms'</color>.
#StoryText35200,And you need <color=#FFFF00>'special slaves'</color> to breed them.
#StoryText35300,I'll give you a special slave as a gift.
#StoryText35400,This slave could carry the child of a large monster.
#StoryText35500,Slaves with <color=#FFFF00>'this ability of 3'</color> can conceive and <color=#FFFF00>'give birth to large monsters'</color>..

#StoryText35600,Do you know about <color=#FFFF00>'market rate'</color>?
#StoryText35700,<color=#FFFF00>'The market rate changes every night/day.'</color> Good luck with that.

#StoryText35800,You earn <color=#FFFF00>'Achievement points when performing certain actions'</color>.
#StoryText35810,You can <color=#FFFF00>'Use achievement points'</color> to <color=#FFFF00>'Upgrade NPC's abilities'</color>.
#StoryText35820,There is no order of upgrades, you can <color=#FFFF00>'choose what you want to upgrade'</color>.

#StoryText35900,Various events occur depending on the player's behavior.
#StoryText36000,Since most events interfere with play, play carefully to prevent them from occurring.

#StoryText36100,It's been a long time since I showed my ability.
#StoryText36200,let me take it~

#StoryText36300,A Slave got a <color=#FF0000>'STD'</color>.
#StoryText36400,Let's take care of it because if you leave it as it is, the venereal disease will spread and the value of your products will decrease.
#StoryText36500,<color=#FFFF00>'Stock condoms to prevent STDs.'</color>.

#StoryText36600,How about expanding your business from now on?
#StoryText36700,Let's remodel the empty above-ground space and use it as a <color=#FFFF00>'brothel'</color>.
#StoryText36800,You can now receive clients.
#StoryText36900,Before that, let me introduce you to <color=#FFFF00>'the employees of the business'</color>.
#StoryText37000,Sisters <color=#FFD158>'Sena'</color> and <color=#FFD158>'Lena'</color> are going to take charge of <color=#FFFF00>'the brothel's information and sales'</color>.
#StoryText37100,Good morning!
#StoryText37200,Good morning...
#StoryText37300,Then, let's start a brothel business together with them.
#StoryText37400,Come here. Let's get started.

#StoryText37500,Well, I'll educate you.
#StoryText37600,Me and my sister look at the counter here and will guide you to the <color=#FFFF00>'facilities that clients want'</color>!
#StoryText37700,If you want to operate efficiently, I think it would be better to have <color=#FFFF00>'various facilities...'</color>
#StoryText37800,We also sell <color=#FFFF00>'condoms'</color>!
#StoryText37900,Just in case, we can <color=#FFFF00>'prevent venereal diseases in clients...'</color>
#StoryText38000,They also sell <color=#FFFF00>'love gel'</color>!
#StoryText38100,It softens the insertion and <color=#FFFF00>'reduces the client's usage time...'</color>
#StoryText38200,We sell weird sex stuff, too!
#StoryText38300,<color=#FFFF00>'Cosmetic potion'</color> can <color=#FFFF00>'change the appearance of slaves or monsters at will...'</color>
#StoryText38400,Now, try building a facility.

#StoryText38500,It's our first client!
#StoryText38600,You have to put a slave in place so she can spread her legs for the clients.
#StoryText38700,We'll take care of slave's health, but it's not under our jurisdiction if slaves run away...
#StoryText38800,So if you want to minimize the damage, you'd better deploy <color=#FFFF00>'slaves whose depravity has been maximized...'</color>

#StoryText38900,If clients use our girls, it will improve our <color=#FFFF00>'reputation'</color>. The more reputable you are, <color=#FFFF00>'the more facilities and clients you will have!'</color>
#StoryText39000,So watch your reputation. Clean up, too!
#StoryText39100,That's it for our explanation, and We're looking forward to working with you!
#StoryText39200,Let's keep in touch...

#StoryText39300,You can <color=#FFFF00>'change the appearance of slaves and monsters at will'</color> if you feed the Cosmetic potion.
#StoryText39400,The appearance corrected with the cosmetic potion is <color=#FFFF00>'inherited to the next generation'</color>.

#StoryText39800,The reputation has improved a little...
#StoryText39900,I'll make it possible to use the new facility with the service...
#StoryText40000,From now on, we can offer new services to clients who like bestiality.
#StoryText40100,Added a facility to bestiality show and receive money.
#StoryText40200,In the case of a horse, it is <color=#FFFF00>'treated as a large monster'</color>, and <color=#FFFF00>'the same conditions as a large monster'</color> are required for a horse's pregnancy.
#StoryText40300,Senna and Lena will automatically sell the animal offspring for a fixed price.

#StoryText40400,Your reputation has improved a little!
#StoryText40500,I'll arrange for a new service.
#StoryText40600,You can now serve clients who like to watch birth!
#StoryText40700,A room where you can show birth and receive money has been added.
#StoryText40800,<color=#FFFF00>'You cannot give birth to monsters, only humans and animals can give birth'</color> in the aboveground facilities.

#StoryText40900,Your reputation has improved a little...
#StoryText41000,Here's a new facility and service...
#StoryText41100,You can offer advanced services.

#StoryText41200,Your reputation has gone up a lot!
#StoryText41300,Here's a new facility and service...
#StoryText41400,VVIP rooms offer top-of-the-line service!
#StoryText41500,The VVIP room is a <color=#FFFF00>'special facility'</color> where <color=#FFFF00>'only one'</color> can be built.
#StoryText41600,It's a rich man-only facility where <color=#FFFF00>'complete-depravity slaves, and ones who don't have venereal diseases, can be deployed'</color>.
#StoryText41700,Up to <color=#FFFF00>'two slaves'</color> can be assigned, and the girls will dress up as maids.

#StoryText41800,A private estate is now available. You can enter your personal estate by pressing the Estate button.
#StoryText41900,You can build facilities and place slaves and monsters in your personal estate just like the current facility.
#StoryText42000,Resource consumption does not occur in private estates, and clients do not come even if you build a brothel facility.
#StoryText42100,Instead, there is a player character, which can be used to create your illegitimate child, and bring them back to the existing estate.

#StoryText42200,Before we get to work, let's decide on a 'name' for the estate.
#StoryText42300,Please don't give it a foolish name?
#StoryText42400,Well, don't keep me waiting...

#StoryText42500,You're working hard.
#StoryText42600,I'll give you a slave as a gift.
#StoryText42700,This is a fallen Dwarf princesses.
#StoryText42800,She was expensive to aquire, but I will give her to you.
#StoryText42900,Be sure to fill her with lots of babies.

#StoryText43000,This girl is a stripper I cherished, but she's in too much debt.
#StoryText43100,She could never make enough money to repay me with dancing...
#StoryText43200,But if I give her to you, she can pay back her debt with her womb.
#StoryText43300,Make her birth lots of babies and I'll be satisfied.

#StoryText43400,It's been a long time since I've seen a hard worker like you.
#StoryText43500,You know, I have needs too...
#StoryText43600,You may now service me sexually.

#StoryText43700,Thanks to you, my work has been successful.
#StoryText43800,As a gift, I will give you a new slave.
#StoryText43900,She's a pureblood elf and the daughter of the tribe leader. She was my childhood friend, but... <BR>Now I can get my revenge on her for allowing them to banish me.
#StoryText44000,My farries kidnapped her on the night before she was to be married.
#StoryText44100,Amilia usually get any girls I aquire, but not her. I want her to become a pathetic breeding sow!
#StoryText44200,Make her birth lots of Monster children. Put her in the brothel and make her birth more elf daughters, then make them serve in the brothel together!
#StoryText44300,...~Ah!... *Ahem.* ...I got excited. Well, let's get back to it.

#StoryText44400,Seeing my old childhood friend bare many monsters and children has gotten me horny.

#StoryText48600,Let me introduce you to my <color=#FFFF00>'Business Partner'</color> here.
#StoryText48700,Her name is <color=#FFFF00>'Barbara'</color>. She'll be in charge of <color=#FFFF00>'room upgrades'</color>.
#StoryText48800,Hi.
#StoryText48900,She can <color=#FFFF00>'upgrade room to add different traits.'</color>.
#StoryText49000,Then, please call her whenever you need her.
#StoryText49100,Call me if you need.

#StoryText49200,Hi.
#StoryText49300,I'll teach you <color=#FFFF00>'how to upgrade a room'</color>.
#StoryText49400,<color=#FFFF00>'Click here'</color>.
#StoryText49500,<color=#FFFF00>'Choose the room you want to upgrade'</color>.
#StoryText49600,Then, <color=#FFFF00>'the trait will be added to the room'</color>.
#StoryText49700,The more you <color=#FFFF00>'upgrade the room'</color>, the more I'll add a better <color=#FFFF00>'machine that automatically increases the corruption of slaves'</color>.
#StoryText49800,Well then, good luck in the future, colleague.

#StoryText49900,<color=#FFFF00>'Choose the room'</color> you want to upgrade.
#StoryText50000,The room's <color=#FFFF00>'trait'</color> is attached randomly, and you can increase the <color=#FFFF00>'number of trait points up to three'</color> through <color=#FFFF00>'Barbara upgrade'</color>.

#StoryText50100,You can <color=#FFFF00>'newly adjust your stats through re-upgrade'</color> and <color=#FFFF00>'upgrade and re-upgrade consumes gold'</color>. Through <color=#FFFF00>'Barbara's Upgrades'</color>, <color=#FFFF00>'you can reduce gold cost'</color>.

#StoryText50200,I finished the upgrade.
#StoryText50300,With this, you can <color=#FFFF00>'easily corrupt slaves'</color>.
#StoryText50400,Take it and install it where you want.

#StoryText50500,<color=#FFFF00>'Install the torture chamber wherever you want'</color>.
#StoryText50600,If you <color=#FFFF00>'place a slave in the torture room'</color>, <color=#FFFF00>'the slave's corruption will increase over time'</color>.

#StoryText50700,Thanks to you, business is good.
#StoryText50800,I'll do you a service.
#StoryText50900,Amilia gave it to me, but it's useless.
#StoryText51000,I'll just give it to you. Use it well.

#StoryText51100,Oh, the profit was very good this time.
#StoryText51200,I'll give you something in return.
#StoryText51300,I picked it up on the way.
#StoryText51400,Use it.

#StoryText51500,I've made a lot of money.
#StoryText51600,Thank you.
#StoryText51700,In return, I'll let you fuck me.

#StoryText51800,There was a very strong smell of essence here.
#StoryText51900,Nice to meet you, I'm Rune.
#StoryText52000,Are you... the owner of this place? 
#StoryText52100,Let's make a pack.
#StoryText52200,I've lend you my dark powers. In return, grant me <color=#FFFF00>'essence'</color>.

#StoryText52300,The mysterious girl Rune is from another world.
#StoryText52400,She <color=#FFFF00>'gains essence through sex, milking, and childbirth in the manor'</color>, and can use the essence to <color=#FFFF00>'activiate special abilities'</color>.

#StoryText52500,Now, let me introduce you to just a few of my abilities.
#StoryText52600,I can <color=#FFFF00>'resurrect the dead'</color>.
#StoryText52700,Observe.

#StoryText52800,No corpse?
#StoryText52900,If you don't have one, I'll have to make one. Don't worry about where it's from.
#StoryText53000,<color=#FFFF00>'Choose a corpse'</color> and <color=#FFFF00>'resurrect it'</color>.
#StoryText53100,<color=#FFFF00>'The amount of essence required for each race is different'</color>.
#StoryText53200,You can resurrect a corpse this way.

#StoryText53300,I don't need this anymore.

#StoryText53400,Alright, time for my next ability.
#StoryText53500,Let me introduce you to a  very cute pet from our world. It's a <color=#FFFF00>'Tentacle'</color>.

#StoryText53600,This needs a special room.
#StoryText53700,The right dimentions and atmosphere...
#StoryText53800,Now <color=#FFFF00>'you need eggs to breed tentacles'</color>. I'll give you some now.
#StoryText53900,You can <color=#FFFF00>'grow tentacles in the room'</color> with this.
#StoryText54000,Let's breed.
#StoryText54100,We got cute such tentacles! Tentacles are really, really cute and useful creatures.
#StoryText54200,If it had tentacles, it would be <color=#FFFF00>'very easy to collect essence'</color>.
#StoryText54300,So I hope you make a lot.

#StoryText54400,To create a tentacle, <color=#FFFF00>'3 tentacle eggs'</color> and <color=#FFFF00>'several essences'</color> are required.

#StoryText54500,Now I will teach you <color=#FFFF00>'how to make a tentacle egg'</color>.
#StoryText54600,Try <color=#FFFF00>'place a slave on a tentacle'</color>.
#StoryText54700,Tentacles are really all-purpose, so if you put a slave here, you can collect essence without having to <color=#FFFF00>'manage'</color> them separately.
#StoryText54800,It's convenient because <color=#FFFF00>'sex, milking, childbirth are all handled in one place'</color>.
#StoryText54900,<color=#FFFF00>'Pregnant Slave'</color>? Now <color=#FFFF00>'I'm going to lay eggs in tentacles'</color>.

#StoryText54950,Click on the tentacles' eggs to pick them up.
#StoryText55000,<color=#FFFF00>'The previous eggs are 1 group'</color>, now if you have <color=#FFFF00>'three of these',</color> you can <color=#FFFF00>'propagate tentacles'</color>.

#StoryText55100,Tentacle eggs are really useful, they taste good, they are good for stamina, and they are also very good material.
#StoryText55200,<color=#FFFF00>You can 'Bring in, Sell or Create Tentacles'</color>; it's up to you.
#StoryText55300,If <color=#FFFF00>'Give me the egg back, I'll change it to essence'</color>.

#StoryText55400,When a slave is placed in the tentacle room, <color=#FFFF00>'sex, milking, and childbirth are all automatic'</color>.
#StoryText55500,Also, dlaves placed in the tentacle room<color=#FFFF00>' automatically receive care'</color>.

#StoryText55600,In order to create a tentacle room, you can create a tentacle room by mixing a <color=#FFFF00>'breeding room'</color>, <color=#FFFF00>'3 tentacle eggs'</color> and <color=#FFFF00>'100 essence'</color>.

#StoryText55700,Well, that's the basic idea.
#StoryText55800,Good luck in the future.
#StoryText55900,If you gather all the essence to me.
#StoryText56000,Let me tell you about one of my special abilities.
#StoryText56100,If Rune gets <color=#FFFF00>'666 essence, special changes'</color> will activate.

#StoryText56200,Are you full?
#StoryText56300,Now, it's time for me to go back to being myself.
#StoryText56400,As promised last time, I'll tell you one of my special abilities.
#StoryText56500,Do you have a favorite service provider among the girls here?
#StoryText56600,I'll <color=#FFFF00>'brainwash'</color> her so she can do whatever you want.

#StoryText56700,Rune can <color=#FFFF00>'brainwash an NPC'</color> by consuming <color=#FFFF00>'666 essence'</color>. The brainwashed NPC will be <color=#FFFF00>'placed in your personal territory'</color> and can <color=#FFFF00>'pregnant the player's child'</color>.
#StoryText56800,However, for <color=#FFFF00>'brainwashing'</color>, <color=#FFFF00>'NPC favorability must be Max'</color> and the <color=#FFFF00>'Personal Territory'</color> is required.

#StoryText56900,Who are you going to brainwash?
#StoryText57000,Now you can do whatever you want.
#StoryText57100,I don't think it will work because she doesn't like you, try making her like you.
#StoryText57200,Trying to get a girl without a home?
#StoryText57300,Brainwashing is not omnipotent.

#StoryText57400,Where did this get from?
#StoryText57500,It is a very good quality mana stone.
#StoryText57600,If it's of this quality, it's probably worth more than <color=#FFFF00>'5000 gold'</color> on the market.
#StoryText57700,I don't know where you got this from, but anything that makes money is fine.
#StoryText57800,I will buy this mana stone for <color=#FFFF00>'5000 gold'</color> in the future.

#StoryText57900,Now... it's time to make your wish come true
#StoryText58000,What am I doing?
#StoryText58100,I never said that <color=#FFFF00>'your wish'</color> will come true in the first place.
#StoryText58200,You did a good job. Since you're useful, I'll take special <color=#FFFF00>'care'</color> of you.
#StoryText58300,Let's do our best in the future, partner.
